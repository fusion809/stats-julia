# Statistics in Julia
My original plan for this repository was to perform all the one-way statistical tests that I've performed on my STA3300 experimental project data using a single Julia script. Unfortunately, I found the available statistics libraries for Julia left a lot to be desired, as I found both GLM and MixedAnova difficult to use to perform the analysis of deviance I would like to perform on my gamma generalized linear model (very easy to get type errors). When I overcame these errors, I received a p-value that was heavily rounded, hence making it difficult to fairly compare to the p-values I obtained from my likelihood-ratio tests. ANOVA tests had similar issues in Julia. So I decided to write an R script to perform the gamma GLM analysis of deviance and linear model ANOVA tests and call this R script within my Julia script.
